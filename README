How to compile?
cmake .
make
- output file: bin/jpet_mc

How to create documentation?
make doc
- open the doc/index.html in your favourite web browser 

TODO:
1. check geometry overlapping
2. user friendly interface
3. fill all information in root trees
4. include big annihilation chamber (2g /3g direct annihilations)
5. integrate with framework output  (separate program - cosmics from data runs; input should check if number of generated events 
corresponds to the source activity)
